Wastewater Treatment and Reuse for Member Textile Industries by Chinnakkarai CETP

UWR RoU Scope: 5

Scope 5: Conservation measures taken to
recycle and/or reuse water, spent +washing
wastewater etc. across or within specific
industrial processes and systems, including
wastewater recycled/ reused in a different
process, but within the same site or location
of the project activity. Recycled wastewater
used in off-site landscaping, gardening or tree
plantations/forests activity are also eligible
under this Scope.

Chinnakkarai Common Effluent Treatment Plant Private Limited operates an integrated Common Effluent Treatment
Plant (CETP) with a treatment capacity of 8 million litres per day (MLD). The facility was first commissioned on 13th
January 1999 and serves 31 member industrial units, ensuring responsible and sustainable water management.
The project participant holds both exclusive water user rights within the defined project boundary and the legal land
title for the project site, which spans 7.54 acres. These rights facilitate full control over water resource utilization and
infrastructure development.

With a total capital investment of ₹55.88 Crores, the project covers all critical components, including construction,
equipment procurement, permitting, and operational setup. The company has secured all required approvals from
relevant regulatory bodies, demonstrating full compliance with applicable environmental and industrial regulations.
This project activity underscores a strong commitment to sustainable water reuse and treatment, aligning with national
legal frameworks and environmental standards. 

The selection of the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system for the Chinnakarai Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP)
was the result of a comprehensive evaluation of local geographic, climatic, and hydrological conditions. The project site
is located in Tirupur, a region characterized by semi-arid topography, erratic rainfall, and significant stress on both
surface and groundwater resources. The terrain is largely undulating and lacks robust natural drainage systems,
especially during the dry season. As a result, traditional disposal or dilution-based methods of effluent management
were deemed inappropriate for the area.

Rainfall in Tirupur averages around 754 mm annually, but it is highly seasonal and concentrated within a few weeks of
the year, leading to negligible natural recharge of water bodies or aquifers. Furthermore, the hydrogeological profile of
the region indicates over-exploited aquifers with shallow, brackish, or saline groundwater. Most of the groundwater
extracted in this area is already considered unsuitable for industrial or domestic use without treatment. Continued
abstraction would only aggravate water table depletion and salinity intrusion, making it an unsustainable source for any
effluent dilution or disposal system.

Surface water options were also considered. However, the Noyyal River, which flows close to the Chinnakarai industrial
cluster, has historically been a recipient of untreated or partially treated effluent, leading to heavy pollution loads,
ecological degradation, and civic protests. Environmental regulations now prohibit any form of surface discharge into
the river or its tributaries. This context rules out surface discharge as a viable or legal option, even for treated water.
Alternative strategies such as marine discharge, where treated effluent is transported to the sea via pipeline for
dispersion, were examined. However, the nearest coastline is over 250 kilometres away, and the high capital
investment, energy requirements, and right-of-way challenges make this method logistically and economically
unfeasible for a cluster-scale project like Chinnakarai CETP. Additionally, the environmental risks associated with largescale marine disposal further limit its acceptability under Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) guidelines.

Historically, member dyeing units used solar evaporation pans for effluent disposal. Although simple in concept, this
method has led to severe environmental damage in the past. The open pans require significant land area, often leak
salts into the soil, and can overflow during rainfall events, causing localized contamination and community health risks.
TNPCB has explicitly discouraged this method and issued closure notices to several non-compliant units.
Given these constraints, the ZLD method was selected as the most technically sound and environmentally sustainable
solution for managing the high-TDS effluent generated by the 31 member dyeing units. ZLD integrates physical,
biological, and advanced membrane technologies to ensure over 90% water recovery, with the remaining concentrate
managed through evaporation and crystallization. The recovered water is reused within the member units, significantly
reducing their dependency on freshwater sources, while sodium sulphate salts are recovered and reused in the dyeing
process, creating a closed-loop system.

This decision aligns with Tamil Nadu’s mandatory ZLD policy for textile clusters and ensures full compliance with
environmental norms. The choice was supported by feasibility studies conducted by Tamil Nadu Water Investment
Company Ltd. (TWIC), which demonstrated that ZLD is both technically viable and economically justifiable in the context
of Tirupur’s environmental and industrial challenges.
